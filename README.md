# Sentence Encoder

An API + GUI built on top of the Universal Sentence Encoder that lets the user enter sentences
and find similar ones in a Word document transcript. The user can add a custom threshold (between 0 and 1)
which represents the percentage above which the text sentences must be correlated to the input.
